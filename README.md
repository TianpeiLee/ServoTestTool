## Introduction

This is a servo testing tool program that can be directly compiled and downloaded through MRS.<br>
It can output 50Hz PWM signals, Dshot300 signals, and Dshot600 signals for testing servo or electronic speed controllers (ESC).
The controller is a 32-bit RISC-V chip with high cost-effectiveness,which can be detailed in the [schematic diagram](https://github.com/TianpeiLee/ServoTestTool/blob/main/ServoTest_SCH.pdf).<br>
